                <p>In The Seven Year Slip, Clementine, a dedicated book publicist, is struggling with grief after the death of her beloved aunt. When she moves into her late aunt’s Manhattan apartment, she soon discovers something extraordinary—the apartment inexplicably connects her to the past, exactly seven years earlier. In this past timeline, she meets Iwan, an ambitious young chef with a passion for adventure and a dream of seeing the world. Despite knowing they are living in different timelines, the two form a deep and undeniable connection.<br><br>

                    As Clementine continues her life in the present, she finds herself drawn to the past whenever she enters the apartment, falling more in love with Iwan each time. However, she knows that their relationship exists within an impossible timeline—one that is already written. While navigating her demanding career and personal struggles, she begins to question whether fate has brought them together or if she is simply clinging to a love that was never meant to last.<br><br>
                    
                    As the lines between past and present blur, Clementine must decide whether to hold onto a love that exists outside of time or embrace the uncertainty of her future. The Seven Year Slip is a heartwarming and bittersweet tale of love, loss, and the magic of timing, exploring whether love can truly transcend time or if some connections are only meant to exist for a fleeting moment. </p>

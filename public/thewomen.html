                <h3>Kristin Hannah</h3>
                <p class="genre"><strong>Genre: </strong> Historical Fiction</p>
                <p class="published"><strong>Published:</strong> 2024</p>
                <p>Frances “Frankie” McGrath is a young woman from a privileged California family who has always followed the rules and lived in the shadow of her older brother. But when he is sent to fight in Vietnam, she makes a bold decision that changes her life forever—she joins the Army Nurse Corps and is deployed to the war zone. Suddenly thrust into the horrors of combat, Frankie witnesses firsthand the brutality of war, tending to wounded soldiers in makeshift hospitals while struggling with the fear and chaos that surrounds her.<br><br>

                    As she grows into her role, Frankie forms deep bonds with fellow nurses and soldiers, each carrying their own burdens of loss and resilience. But when she finally returns home, she faces an unexpected battle—the world she left behind refuses to acknowledge the sacrifices of women in Vietnam. Instead of being celebrated, she is met with dismissal and shame, forcing her to fight for recognition, healing, and a new sense of purpose.<br><br>

                    A powerful and emotional novel, The Women shines a light on the often-overlooked contributions of female veterans, capturing the strength, heartbreak, and courage of those who served. Kristin Hannah delivers a moving tribute to the women of war, exploring themes of love, sacrifice, and the search for identity in a world unwilling to understand their experiences.</p>

                <p class="genre"><strong>Genre:</strong> Romance</p>

                <p>Love and Other Words by Christina Lauren is a deeply emotional second-chance romance that explores love, loss, and the power of words. The novel follows Macy Sorensen, a woman who has built a carefully controlled life as a pediatric resident, engaged to a man who offers stability rather than passion. But when she unexpectedly runs into Elliot Petropoulos—the boy who once held her heart—her carefully constructed world begins to unravel.<br><br>

                    Told through a dual timeline, the story alternates between Macy and Elliot’s past and present. As teenagers, they bonded over their shared love of books, spending weekends in a cozy reading nook in Macy’s family's vacation home. Their friendship slowly blossomed into love, but a heartbreaking event tore them apart, leaving them estranged for years. Now, seeing Elliot again forces Macy to confront the pain of their past and the truth about why they fell apart.<br><br>
                    
                    As their connection reignites, Macy must decide if she can open her heart again to the one person who truly knew her. But before they can move forward, they must face the past that still lingers between them. Love and Other Words is a beautifully written, tender story about first love, heartbreak, and the rare second chances that can change everything. </p>

                <p class="genre"><strong>Genre:</strong> Romance</p>
                <p class="published"><strong>Published:</strong> 2024</p>
                <p>Just for the Summer by Abby Jimenez follows Emma and Justin, two people who believe they are cursed—every person they date finds true love immediately after breaking up with them. When they connect through a viral Reddit thread discussing their shared misfortune, they come up with a plan: date each other for the summer, break up, and finally break their so-called curse<br><br>

                    As they spend the summer together, their arrangement starts to feel less like a strategy and more like something real. Emma and Justin find themselves drawn to each other in ways they hadn’t expected, sharing deep conversations, laughter, and a growing emotional bond. However, both are hesitant to admit their true feelings, afraid that their past patterns will repeat and their time together is destined to end.<br><br>
                    
                    As summer winds down, they must confront whether their "curse" is real or just an excuse to avoid taking risks in love. With heartfelt moments, humor, and emotional depth, Just for the Summer explores fate, self-discovery, and the courage to believe in love—even when the odds seem stacked against it.</p>

                <p>The Ballad of Never After (2022) by Stephanie Garber continues Evangeline Fox’s journey as she tries to reclaim her fate after the heartbreak caused by Jacks, the Prince of Hearts. Determined to avoid further deception, she swears never to trust him again. However, when a dangerous new curse threatens her world, she has no choice but to rely on him once more. As she searches for answers, Evangeline is drawn deeper into the enchanted North, where magic and fate weave a treacherous path filled with secrets, lies, and unexpected alliances.<br><br>
                    
                    As Evangeline unravels the mystery of an ancient prophecy, she begins to question everything she thought she knew about heroes, villains, and true love. The more she fights against destiny, the more entangled she becomes in Jacks’ dangerous game—one where the stakes could mean life, death, or an ending worse than both. With twists at every turn and emotions running high, The Ballad of Never After is a captivating tale of romance, betrayal, and the power of believing in one’s own story.</p>

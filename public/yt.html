                <p>A heartfelt and charming romance about second chances, personal healing, and an unexpected love that feels meant to be. Dr. Briana Ortiz is going through a rough patch—her divorce is final, her brother is in desperate need of a kidney transplant, and the last thing she needs is a new colleague stepping on her toes at work. When Dr. Jacob Maddox arrives at her hospital, he immediately earns a reputation for being standoffish. But when he unexpectedly writes Briana a letter, she discovers a different side of him—one that is thoughtful, kind, and struggling with his own anxieties.<br><br>

                    As they exchange more letters, a friendship blossoms, and Jacob makes a surprising offer—he’s a match for her brother’s transplant and is willing to donate his kidney. Their connection deepens as Briana realizes that Jacob’s quiet nature hides a heart as big as her own. When he asks her to fake date him to ease pressure from his family, Briana agrees, but the lines between pretend and real quickly blur. The more time they spend together, the harder it becomes to ignore their growing feelings.<br><br>
                    
                    But love isn’t always easy, especially when past heartbreaks and personal fears stand in the way. As Briana and Jacob navigate their complicated emotions, they must decide if they’re willing to take a chance on something real. Yours Truly is a beautiful, slow-burn romance filled with witty banter, emotional depth, and the reminder that sometimes, love arrives when you least expect it.</p>

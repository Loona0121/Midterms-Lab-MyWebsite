                <h1>All the Night We Cannot See</h1>
                <h3>Anthony Doerr</h3>
                <p class="genre"><strong>Genre: </strong>Historical Fiction</p>
                <p class="published"><strong>Published:</strong> 2014</p>
                <p>Set during World War II, All the Light We Cannot See follows two parallel stories: Marie-Laure, a blind French girl, and Werner, a German orphan with a talent for radio mechanics. Marie-Laure and her father flee Paris to escape the Nazi occupation, seeking refuge in the coastal town of Saint-Malo. Her father, a locksmith for the Museum of Natural History, carries a priceless jewel rumored to be cursed. As war rages on, Marie-Laure must navigate her new life in hiding while clinging to hope and the radio broadcasts that connect her to the outside world.<br><br>

                    Meanwhile, Werner grows up in Germany, fascinated by radios and how they work. His skills earn him a place in an elite Nazi academy, where he is trained to track down resistance fighters through illegal radio transmissions. As he is pulled deeper into the war, Werner struggles with the morality of his actions. Eventually, his path crosses with Marie-Laureâ€™s in a way that will change both of their lives forever.<br><br>

                    A beautifully written novel about resilience, fate, and the unseen connections between people, All the Light We Cannot See explores the human cost of war and the small acts of kindness that endure even in the darkest times.</p>

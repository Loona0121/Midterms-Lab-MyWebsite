                        Yours Truly easily earns a 5/5 from me. This book felt deeply personal because of how much I related to Jacob, the male lead. His struggles with social anxiety—the overthinking, the avoidance, the exhaustion from trying to navigate social situations—were written in such a raw and realistic way that it felt like I was reading about myself at times.<br><br>
                        I loved how the book didn’t just use his anxiety as a character trait but truly explored how it affected his relationships, work, and self-worth. His dynamic with Briana was heartwarming, and I appreciated how she took the time to understand him instead of trying to "fix" him. Their slow-burn romance was so well done, and the way they communicated (especially through letters) made everything feel even more meaningful.<br><br>
                        This story wasn’t just about love—it was about finding someone who makes you feel safe, seen, and understood. It was emotional, funny, and so comforting to read. Definitely one of my all-time favorites.

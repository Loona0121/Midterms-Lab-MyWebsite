                <h1>A Court of Thorns and Roses</h1>
                <h3>Sarah J. Maas</h3>
                <p class="genre"><strong>Genre:</strong> Fantasy</p>
                <p class="published"><strong>Published:</strong> 2015</p>
                <p>Feyre Archeron, a nineteen-year-old huntress, struggles to provide for her impoverished family in the harsh winter months. When she kills a wolf in the woods, she unknowingly breaks an ancient treaty between humans and fae. Soon after, a powerful faerie named Tamlin arrives at her doorstep, demanding retribution. Instead of death, she is taken to the magical land of Prythian, where she must live in Tamlin’s court. Though initially fearful and resentful, Feyre begins to uncover the beauty of the fae world and develops a complicated relationship with her captor.<br><br>

                    As Feyre and Tamlin grow closer, she learns that a dark force is threatening all of Prythian. A mysterious blight is weakening Tamlin and his court, and Feyre finds herself caught in a dangerous web of secrets and ancient magic. When a ruthless fae ruler named Amarantha emerges as the true threat behind the kingdom’s suffering, Feyre is forced to make an impossible choice—risk everything to save Tamlin or return to the human world and leave him to his fate. To prove her love and break the curse binding Tamlin, she must endure deadly trials that test her strength, wit, and willpower.<br><br>
                    
                    A Court of Thorns and Roses is a gripping fantasy romance inspired by Beauty and the Beast, blending high-stakes adventure, court intrigue, and a slow-burning love story. As Feyre navigates the complexities of the fae world, she discovers her own strength and the sacrifices she must make to protect those she loves, setting the stage for even greater battles to come.</p>

                <h1>The Fault in Our Stars</h1>
                <h3>John Green</h3>
                <p class="genre"><strong>Genre: </strong>Young Adult</p>
                <p class="published"><strong>Published:</strong> 2019</p>
                <p>Juliette Ferrars has been locked away for 264 days, imprisoned for a power she doesn’t understand—her touch is lethal. In a world ravaged by war, disease, and strict government control under the Reestablishment, she has been seen as nothing more than a dangerous weapon. But when she is suddenly released into the hands of Warner, a ruthless commander who wants to use her power for his own gain, Juliette must decide if she will be a pawn in his game or fight for her freedom.<br><br>

                    As she navigates this new world, she reunites with Adam, a soldier from her past who sees her as more than a monster. With his help, Juliette begins to uncover the truth about her abilities and the power she holds—not just to destroy, but to change the world. Torn between duty, love, and the temptation of power, Juliette embarks on a journey of self-discovery, learning that she may be far more powerful than anyone ever imagined.<br><br>

                    Filled with poetic prose, intense romance, and high-stakes action, Shatter Me is the first book in a thrilling dystopian series that explores themes of identity, power, and rebellion.</p>

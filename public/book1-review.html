                    <p>
                        The "Only One Left" by Riley Sager is one of the many books that I finished reading within a day. I was already hooked at the start that I couldn't put the book down. There was this feeling of excitement and curiosity within me to know the answers to many questions and guess the twists in the story.<br><br>
                        It is a gothic thriller that kept me on edge from start to finish. The eerie setting of a crumbling mansion on the Maine coast sets the perfect tone for a story filled with dark secrets, deception, and unexpected twists.<br><br>
                        One of the book’s strongest points is how it keeps you guessing. Just when I thought I had figured things out, another revelation would change everything because the plot twists are literally unexpected. However, the ending felt a bit overwhelming. The number of twists in the final part of made it seem like the story was trying too hard to surprise the reader, rather than letting the suspense unfold naturally.<br><br>
                        Despite that, I still enjoyed the book a lot. The atmosphere, the characters, and the slow build-up of tension made it a thrilling read. If not for the slightly excessive twists at the end, I would have given it a solid five stars.

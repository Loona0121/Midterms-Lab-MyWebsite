                <p class="genre"><strong>Genre:</strong> Fantasy</p>
                <p class="published"><strong>Published:</strong> 2019</p>
                <p>After being exiled from the land of Elfhame by her husband, High King Cardan, Jude Duarte is forced to live among mortals, struggling with her sudden loss of power. But when her twin sister, Taryn, arrives with a desperate plea for help, Jude seizes the opportunity to return to the faerie world—though doing so means disguising herself and walking into enemy territory. As she navigates the treacherous court politics, Jude must confront old foes, unexpected allies, and the ever-present danger of her growing feelings for Cardan.<br><br>

                    Elfhame is on the brink of war, and Jude soon finds herself at the heart of a conflict that could reshape the entire kingdom. As secrets unravel and betrayals come to light, she must decide whether to embrace her destiny as the rightful Queen of Elfhame or remain in the shadows. Meanwhile, Cardan’s cryptic actions leave her questioning his true intentions, forcing Jude to determine whether their bond is built on manipulation or something deeper. When an ancient curse threatens to destroy everything, Jude must make the ultimate sacrifice to save both the kingdom and the one she loves.<br><br>
                    
                    Filled with political intrigue, high-stakes betrayals, and a captivating enemies-to-lovers romance, The Queen of Nothing delivers a thrilling conclusion to The Folk of the Air trilogy. Jude’s journey from exile to ruler tests her cunning, resilience, and heart, proving that power is not just about strength but also the willingness to risk everything for those she holds dear.                </p>

                <p class="genre"><strong>Genre: </strong>Historical Fiction</p>
                <p class="published"><strong>Published:</strong> 2017</p>
                <p>Spanning nearly a century, Pachinko follows four generations of a Korean family as they navigate love, survival, and identity across Korea and Japan. The story begins in the early 1900s, when a young Korean woman, Sunja, falls in love with a wealthy, mysterious businessman. When she becomes pregnant, she soon learns that he is already married. Refusing to become his mistress, she accepts a marriage proposal from a kind but poor minister, Baek Isak, who offers her a new life in Japan.<br><br>

                    As Sunja settles into her new reality, she and her family face relentless discrimination and hardship as Koreans living in Japan. Through decades of war, economic struggle, and cultural alienation, her descendants fight to carve out a place in a society that sees them as outsiders. Her son, Noa, dreams of assimilation, while her younger son, Mozasu, embraces the lucrative but corrupt world of pachinko gambling. Their stories intertwine with love, ambition, and sacrifice as they each grapple with questions of belonging and identity.<br><br>

                    Richly detailed and emotionally resonant, Pachinko explores themes of fate, resilience, and the unbreakable bonds of family. Min Jin Lee masterfully captures the struggles of immigrants and the generational burdens they carry, crafting a sweeping, unforgettable tale of perseverance and hope.</p>

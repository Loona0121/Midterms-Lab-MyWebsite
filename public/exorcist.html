                <h1>The Exorcist's House</h1>
                <h3>Nick Roberts</h3>
                <p class="genre"><strong>Genre:</strong>Horror</p>
                <p class="published"><strong>Published:</strong> 2022</p>
                <p>In 1994, psychologist Daniel Hill moves his wife, Nora, and their teenage daughter, Alice, to a remote farmhouse in West Virginia, hoping to start fresh. As they begin renovations, they uncover a hidden basement room containing a boarded-up well covered in crucifixes. Though unsettling, Daniel dismisses it—until eerie occurrences escalate into terrifying supernatural disturbances.<br><br>

                    Digging into the home’s history, Daniel learns that the previous owner was an exorcist who fought to contain a powerful demonic entity within the well. By disturbing it, the family has unwittingly released something sinister. Shadows move on their own, whispers fill the night, and Alice begins acting strangely, speaking in voices not her own. The Hill family soon realizes they are trapped in a house that refuses to let them leave.<br><br>

                    As the malevolent force grows stronger, Daniel must confront the dark power that has taken hold of their home and his daughter. Seeking help from a priest, he discovers that some evils can never be truly banished—only contained. With their lives and souls on the line, the family faces a horrifying battle against an entity that has been waiting for its next victims.</p>

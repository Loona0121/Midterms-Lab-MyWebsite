                <h1>To Kill a Mockingbird</h1>
                <h3>Harper Lee</h3>
                <p class="genre"><strong>Genre: </strong>Historical Fiction</p>
                <p class="published"><strong>Published:</strong> 1960</p>
                <p>Set in the racially segregated American South during the 1930s, To Kill a Mockingbird follows young Scout Finch as she navigates childhood in the small town of Maycomb, Alabama. Through her innocent yet observant eyes, we see the world around her—one shaped by deep-seated prejudice, injustice, and moral complexity. Raised by her widowed father, Atticus Finch, a principled lawyer, and guided by her older brother Jem and their friend Dill, Scout learns valuable lessons about empathy, kindness, and standing up for what is right.<br><br>

                    The heart of the novel revolves around Atticus defending Tom Robinson, a Black man falsely accused of assaulting a white woman. Despite clear evidence of Tom’s innocence, the trial exposes the town’s racism and forces Scout and Jem to confront the harsh realities of their community. As the children grapple with issues of fairness, courage, and integrity, they also encounter the mysterious and reclusive Boo Radley, who becomes a symbol of misunderstood kindness in their journey toward maturity.<br><br>

                    A powerful exploration of morality, justice, and the loss of innocence, To Kill a Mockingbird remains a timeless classic that continues to challenge readers to reflect on issues of race, class, and humanity. With its unforgettable characters and poignant storytelling, Harper Lee’s novel has left a lasting impact on literature and society since its publication.</p>

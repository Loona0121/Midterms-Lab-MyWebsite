                <h1>The Nightingale</h1>
                <h3>Kristin Hannah</h3>
                <p class="genre"><strong>Genre: </strong>Historical Fiction</p>
                <p class="published"><strong>Published:</strong> 2015</p>
                <p>Set in Nazi-occupied France during World War II, The Nightingale follows the lives of two sisters, Vianne Mauriac and Isabelle Rossignol, as they navigate love, loss, and survival in the face of war. Vianne, a quiet school teacher, is forced to host a German officer in her home when her husband is sent to fight, struggling to protect her daughter while grappling with the impossible choices war demands. Meanwhile, her rebellious younger sister, Isabelle, joins the French Resistance, risking her life to smuggle downed Allied pilots across the Pyrenees mountains to safety.<br><br>

                    As the war intensifies, Vianne is forced to make unimaginable sacrifices to keep her family safe, while Isabelle’s defiance places her in constant danger. Each sister embarks on a different, yet equally harrowing, journey—one of quiet endurance and another of bold resistance. Despite their contrasting approaches, both women demonstrate extraordinary courage as they fight against oppression in their own ways.<br><br>

                    A heart-wrenching tale of bravery, love, and resilience, The Nightingale highlights the often-overlooked role of women in war. Kristin Hannah delivers an emotional and powerful tribute to the strength of the human spirit, showing that even in the darkest times, hope and sacrifice can shine through.</p>

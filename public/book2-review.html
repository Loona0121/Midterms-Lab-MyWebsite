                    <h2>Review</h2>
                    <p>
                        At first, I thought this would be a typical YA mystery—fun but predictable. But Pip, the main character, proved me wrong. She wasn’t just some teenage girl playing detective; she was smart, determined, and incredibly relatable. I loved how she approached the case logically, gathering evidence and questioning suspects like a real investigator. She wasn’t reckless or impulsive just for the sake of the plot, which made her character feel authentic.<br><br>
                        the mystery is brilliant, including the interview transcripts, diary notes, and investigation logs that made me feel like I was solving the case alongside Pip. The suspense kept building, and by the time I reached the final twist, I was shocked.<br><br>
                        side from the mystery, I also loved the book’s themes—the idea that people aren't always who they seem, how power and privilege can influence justice, and the impact of crime on an entire community. It wasn’t just about solving a murder; it was about uncovering secrets that people wanted buried forever.<br><br>
                        If you love fast-paced, mind-twisting mysteries with a sharp, determined protagonist, A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder is a must-read.

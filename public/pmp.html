                <p>Practice Makes Perfect by Sarah Adams is a charming small-town romance about stepping out of your comfort zone to find love where you least expect it. Annie Walker, a sweet and steady florist in Rome, Kentucky, has always dreamed of a love story like the ones in her favorite books. But despite being ready to settle down, she can’t seem to find the right person—someone who sees her as more than just the nice girl next door. When she realizes she might need to shake things up, she turns to the last person anyone would expect: Will Griffin, the rugged and guarded bodyguard to her famous sister-in-law.<br><br>

                    Will is everything Annie isn’t—worldly, tough, and completely uninterested in settling down. But when Annie asks him to teach her how to be more confident and flirtatious, he reluctantly agrees. What starts as a lighthearted lesson quickly turns into something deeper as Will discovers there’s much more to Annie than meets the eye. She challenges his carefully built walls, making him question the solitary life he’s chosen. Annie, in turn, starts to wonder if the perfect love she’s been searching for has been right in front of her all along.<br><br>
                    
                    As their lessons in love become real, both Will and Annie must decide whether to take a leap of faith or let fear hold them back. Practice Makes Perfect is a heartfelt and swoon-worthy romance about taking risks, finding your voice, and realizing that sometimes, love doesn’t follow a perfect plan—it writes its own. With humor, warmth, and undeniable chemistry, Sarah Adams delivers a story that will leave readers smiling long after the final page. </p>

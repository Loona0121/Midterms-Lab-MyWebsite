                <p>A teenage girl wakes up on the side of a dirt road, bruised and disoriented, with no memory of who she is or how she got there. When she’s taken to the police, a man claiming to be her father arrives, providing proof—family photos, a birth certificate, and an ID—all confirming that her name is Mary. But something doesn’t feel right. No matter how much she tries to believe it, deep inside, she knows Mary isn’t her real name.<br><br>

                    As she struggles to piece together her past, she begins noticing strange inconsistencies in her supposed life. The house doesn’t feel like home, the memories he describes don’t come back to her, and an overwhelming sense of fear starts to take hold. Meanwhile, Drew, a teenage boy desperate to find his missing girlfriend, Lola, refuses to give up searching. The more he digs, the more he realizes something sinister is at play, leading him down a path that intertwines with the girl who calls herself Mary.<br><br>

                    As their lives converge, secrets begin to unravel, revealing a terrifying truth neither of them expected. With time running out and the danger closing in, Mary must uncover who she really is before she loses herself completely. That’s Not My Name is a chilling psychological thriller filled with twists, suspense, and the desperate fight for identity in a world full of lies.</p>
